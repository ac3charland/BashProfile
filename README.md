# BashProfile
My favorite shortcuts and functions to improve the Terminal experience.

## To use:
1. Using Terminal, open your bash profile in your editor of choice (the command below will use nano).
  - `nano ~/.bash_profile`
2. Add the following line at the top of the file, with the path to this repo on your machine filled in
  - `source ~/path/to/this/repo/BashProfile/profile.sh`
3. Close and restart your terminal and enjoy!
